# The Health of Massachusetts Education System

What comes to mind when you think of Massachusetts? You think of the Boston Celtics and the New England Patriots, right? Freezing cold weather, lots of historical buildings, top universities such as Harvard and MIT, itâ€™s no wonder why this state is so well known for its education system.

In this article, I dove into the health of the school system in the state of Massachusetts.

The topics that I will be discussing are:

1.	What schools are struggling the most when it comes to graduation.
2.	What cities are earning the most salaries.
3.	What % of students are attending college.
4.	What is the correlation between students with disabilites and graduation rate.

## The Data

The dataset was provided by Avery Smith, my mentor and instructor of Data Analytics Bootcamp.

(Disclaimer: this data set is for educational purposes only)

## The Analysis

*What schools are struggling the most when it comes to graduation?*

Based on the data presented, there are several schools that are struggling more than others. Springfield Public Day High school has the lowest graduation percent with less than 9%.

We can also see that out of the bottom 10 schools with the lowest graduation rates, 2 schools are charter schools and 8 are public schools. It would be beneficial to know what is driving the graduation rates for these schools to better understand and come up with an action plan on how to increase graduation rates.

*What cities are earning the most salaries?*

A chart to visualize the top cities in terms of earnings is a great way to see where the most money is being made in Massachusetts. The top city earning the most salary is Dorchester, Boston with over $10B accounting for 27 total schools. Springfield coming in second with over $7B. The lowest earning school is located in Cuttyhunk with just roughly $55,000.

*What % of students are attending college?*

There are over 300 schools with more than 50% of students attending college. This includes 34 schools that had over 90% attending college. The Gateway to College located in the Ralph C. Mahar district had 100% of students attend college.

We can visually see on the map that there are several areas shaded in light orange which indicate these areas have roughly 30% of students attending college.

*What is the correlation between students with disabilities and graduation rate?*

Based on the scatter plot below, we can see that students with disabilities who have a low economic disadvantage have a high graduation rate. On the other hand, students with disabilities who have a high economic disadvantage fall below the 50% graduation rate.

It is also recognized as being diverse with many options for college preparation and in general higher education programs. Overall, we see that the state puts a lot of efforts to provide an excellent education system for all students.
