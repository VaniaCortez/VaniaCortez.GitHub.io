# 21-22 NBA Data Analysis

The 21-22 NBA season was an exciting year with many talented players and competitive teams. I had the chance to attend several home games for my favorite team, the Miami Heat. If you're ever in Miami, you should definitely try to catch a game, as they have the best player intro and announcer (Mike B) in the league!
In this data analysis, I will be thoroughly examining the data using Tableau to understand the impact of individual players on the 21-22 NBA season.

## The Data

I obtained the dataset from this [link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html)

## The Analysis

### Bubble Plot

The bubble plot below shows the total points and total assists for each player in the league.  
The colors in the graph represent the different player positions, with blue indicating center. The size of the bubbles reflects the total number of rebounds for each player, with larger bubbles representing more rebounds scored.
According to the visualization, players in the center position generally have fewer assists, less than 300. Nikola Jokic, who plays center and was named MVP of the season, is an exception to this trend with a total of 584 assists, 2,004 points, and 1,019 rebounds.

It's worth noting that Lebron James and Kevin Durant, both power forward players, had very similar statistics.
 
o  Total points:
LBJ = 1695; KD = 1643
o  Total Assists:
LBJ = 349; KD = 351
o  Total Rebounds:
LBJ = 459; KD = 407

We also observed that Trae Young, a point guard, was an outlier with over 2000 total points and over 700 total assists. Generally, point guards tend to have more assists, over 400, than players in other positions.

### Heat Map

The heat map shows the 3-point field goal percentage for each team and player position. From the data, we can see that the power forward position for the Sacramento Kings had the highest 3-point field goal percentage, making 50% of their overall 3-point field goals. This means that the power forward position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for the SAC team.
For my home team, the Miami Heat, the point guard position appears to be the most efficient with a 42% 3-point field goal.

### Stacked Bar Chart

The stacked bar chart shows the top players with the most total points per team. It is with no surprise to see Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young, Nikola Jokic, Jayson Tatum, DeMar DeRozan, and Joel Embiid amongst the top 6 players with over 2000 total points.
The team to have the highest total points in the season is the Timberwolves, Minnesota. Their top two players, Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns had a combined total of over 3000 points.

### Tree Map

The tree map is divided into five colors, each representing a player position. From the data, we can see that Trae Young, a point guard, had the highest number of turnovers in the season. However, as we previously noted from the bubble chart, Trae Young also had the highest total points and assists.
The player to come in second with the highest turnovers is Russell Westbrook with just shy of 300 total turnovers for the season.
Although Trae Young and Russell Westbrook had the highest turnovers, they also had a high field goal percentage at around 45%.

## Conclusion

While a player's individual statistics are important, they are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to building a winning team. It's worth noting that none of the players mentioned played for the Golden State Warriors, who won the championship in the 21-22 season.

Nikola Jokic, the MVP of the season and center for the Denver Nuggets, was defeated by the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the western conference playoffs.

Despite Trae Young's impressive points and assists during the season, his team, the Atlanta Hawks, was defeated by the Miami Heat in the first round of the eastern conference playoffs. The Miami Heat eventually lost in the Eastern Conference Finals in game 7 by a margin of only 4 points!

In other words, it takes a well-organized team to win a championship.

So, I must end this with...

Letâ€™s Go Heat!
