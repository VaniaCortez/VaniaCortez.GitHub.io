As someone who is a big foodie and loves trying new restaurants, I have been using Door Dash on a frequent basis.

Door Dash is a technology company that connects people with one of their best neighborhood restaurants, grocery stores, and much more. I chose this project to get a better understanding of the company and its business in the food delivery industry.
