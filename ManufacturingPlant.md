It’s not a typical day where I am searching on google for the meaning of froth flotation. 

I was surprised to learn about the process of mineral separation through a process called froth flotation. It is satisfying and intriguing to see how this method is used to separate minerals. 

Froth flotation is a method used in the mining industry to separate valuable minerals from unwanted material. It involves a mixture of ore and water into a tank known as a flotation cell. Then, it forms air bubbles, and the valuable minerals attach to the bubbles form a frothy layer on the surface. This frothy material, called the concentrate, is then skimmed off the top, while the unwanted material sinks to the bottom. 

The process is named froth flotation because it relies on the formation of a frothy layer on the surface.
