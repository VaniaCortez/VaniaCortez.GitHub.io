# Silica Concentrate Prediction in Iron Ore

It’s not a typical day where I am searching on google for the meaning of froth flotation. 

I was surprised to learn about the process of mineral separation through a process called froth flotation. It is satisfying and intriguing to see how this method is used to separate minerals. 

Froth flotation is a method used in the mining industry to separate valuable minerals from unwanted material. It involves a mixture of ore and water into a tank known as a flotation cell. Then, it forms air bubbles, and the valuable minerals attach to the bubbles form a frothy layer on the surface. This frothy material, called the concentrate, is then skimmed off the top, while the unwanted material sinks to the bottom. 

The process is named froth flotation because it relies on the formation of a frothy layer on the surface.

## The Data

This dataset is from March 2017 – September 2017.
Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process?resource=download) to obtain the dataset. 

The purpose of this project is to predict the % Silica concentrate.  

Silica is considered a gangue mineral, meaning that it is a mineral that is unwanted and not valuable. In iron ore flotation, silica is often present in the ore and can be separated from the valuable iron minerals using various reagents such as Amina. 

In this analysis, we can estimate the concentration of silica in iron ore, thus reducing the amount of time and resources needed for the detection process during iron ore processing.

To conduct this data analysis, I used a browser based Python called Deepnote.
