# World Bank - IDA Data Analysis

The International Development Association (IDA) is a part of the World Bank Group that provides interest-free loans and grants to the poorest countries in the world. IDA loans can be used to finance a wide range of activities, including infrastructure projects, social services, and economic reforms.

They focus on boosting economic growth by building schools, hospitals, creating better jobs, and more.  
 
For this article, I analyzed the credits/grants statements of IDA to answer the following questions:  
 
1)	What is the average principal amount loan to countries? 

2)	What are the top 5 countries with the most loan transactions per country?

3)	Which country has the highest obligation amount due? 

4)	What are the top 10 projects with the most loan transactions that are currently being repaid?


## The Data

The data was obtained through this link [World Bank - IDA Statements](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx)

## The Analysis

*What is the average principal amount loan to countries?*

The amount of an IDA loan is typically determined based on the country's poverty level, the size of its economy, and the nature of the project being financed. IDA loans are typically larger for poorer countries and for projects with high development impact.

The average principal amount of a loan from IDA varies depending on the specific needs and circumstances of the country.

Based on the data, the average principal amount loan to countries is approximately $43.54M.

*What are the top 5 countries with the most transactions per country?*

Our data shows that India has the most transactions of any country, with a total of 58,779 transactions. 
Followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Yemen, the South Asia region is also the top region with most transactions. 

It's important to note that the number of transactions is just one factor that can be used to measure the level of development assistance a country receives. Other factors, such as the total amount of financing provided, the specific sectors and projects supported, and the impact of the assistance on the country's development, may also be important considerations.

*Which country has the highest obligation amount due?*

The country with the highest obligation amount due to IDA is India, approximately ~$793M. 
The project with the highest debt amounts due to IDA is “IN: SSA III.” 
It will be interesting to know what these projects entail to better understand how these projects will boost the economic growth in India. 
 
Kenya comes in as the second country to have the highest obligation of ~$781M for the Inclusive Growth and Fiscal DPO project. 

The amount of financing that a country receives from IDA may change over time as new projects are approved and existing projects are completed.

## Conclusion

Overall, the goal of IDA is to help the poorest countries in the world build a better future for their citizens by providing financial and technical support to address development challenges and promote economic growth.

By providing financing and technical assistance to developing countries, IDA has played a crucial role in supporting their efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.
